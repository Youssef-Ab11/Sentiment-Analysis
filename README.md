# Sentiment-Analysis
the objectif is to analyse and rate from 1 to 5 the sentiment in the comments of for example a service from yelp.com
so I imported "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment" model from the hugginface library and scrap the reviews from the mentioned page to do a rating of each review
