Got the sandwich and the chicken came in mildly crunchy with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and sweet sauce rather than a spicy red sauce. Chicken is overcooked resulting in a very dry bite, but the sauce and mayonnaise made it a bit easier to digest down. I really believe that this sandwich was going to taste spicy thus I prepared some water beforehand, but unfortunately the sandwich came out as sweet. Where's the red crispy chicken as shown in the picture?\",\n",
